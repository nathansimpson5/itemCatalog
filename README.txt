Item Catalog project for Udacity

To run locally:

Before we run the program, there are several steps that you should take to make sure that you have everything downloaded in order to run the web application.

-   Install Vagrant and VirtualBox if you have not done so already.
-   Download the files for the Item Catalog
-   Launch the Vagrant VM (by typing vagrant up in the directory fullstack/vagrant from the terminal).
-   Run the application within the VM by typing python application.py into the Terminal. If you named the file something other than application.py, in the above command substitute in the file name on your computer.
-   Access the application by visiting http://localhost:5000 locally on your browser.
